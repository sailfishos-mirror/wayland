# Preface

This document describes the (i) Wayland architecture, (ii) Wayland model of
operation and (iii) its library API. Also, the Wayland protocol specification is
shown in the Appendix. This document is aimed primarily at Wayland developers
and those looking to program with it; it does not cover application development.

There have been many contributors to this document and since this is only the
first edition many errors are expected to be found. We appreciate corrections.

Yours, the Wayland open-source community November 2012
